## Description
This repository contains the R Markdown file and associated resources for a simulation study authored by Gabriel Jobert. The paper focuses on employing a Monte Carlo simulation approach to evaluate the impact of missing data on the performance and stability of various statistical methods.

### Objective
The primary objective of this study is to provide insights into how missing data can affect the outcome and reliability of different statistical learning techniques.

### Methods and Libraries Used
- **R Programming**: The analysis and simulations are conducted using R.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `MASS`: For support with statistical functions.
  - `caret`: For data splitting, pre-processing, feature selection, etc.
  - `cluster` & `mclust`: For clustering analysis.
  - `infotheo`: For information theory-based methods.
  - `RANN`: For approximate nearest neighbor techniques.
  - `ggplot2`: For creating elegant data visualisations.
  - `dplyr`: For data manipulation.

## File Structure
- **Simulation Paper.Rmd**: The main R Markdown file containing the study, code, and documentation.
- **HTML version** : The paper in plain word from the RMD file in html version (prefer reading this version than the pdf one).
- **PDF version** : Paper in plain word in PDF version.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have R and the necessary libraries installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the `SImulation Paper.Rmd` file in an R environment like RStudio.
4. Run the code chunks sequentially to reproduce the analysis and view the results.
